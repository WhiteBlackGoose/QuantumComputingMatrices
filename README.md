### Quantum matrix almanac

Here we collect matrices for manual transformations of quantum states, so that you can interact with it right in a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook.

### How to use

It is an [F#](https://fsharp.org) Jupyter notebook, not a python one. F# is a fun language, so if you should learn it! Here are a few ways to use this repo:

- Run [online on MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/WhiteBlackGoose/QuantumComputingMatrices/HEAD)
- View on [NbViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WhiteBlackGoose/QuantumComputingMatrices/blob/main/notebooks/Matrices.ipynb)
- Run locally. Then you need to [make sure](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive#jupyter-and-nteract) to have everything required installed.
